## 📖 About

This project is the backend of **InvoicePilot**, an invoice management platform. Businesses can manage their profile, customers and products, create multi-item invoices with automatic tax and discount calculation, download invoices as PDFs, and email them to customers.

The main goal was to build it the way a real service is built, not as a simple CRUD demo:

- **Slow work never blocks a request.** PDF generation and email delivery run in background workers (BullMQ on Redis) with automatic retries and exponential backoff, and the API answers immediately with `202 Accepted`.
- **Security is layered.** OTP email verification, bcrypt password hashing, short-lived JWT access tokens with rotating refresh tokens in HTTP-only cookies, account lockout, and Redis-backed rate limiting on every sensitive endpoint.
- **It is observable and deployable.** Health probes, Prometheus metrics with a Grafana dashboard, Sentry error tracking, structured JSON logs, a Docker image, and a CI/CD pipeline that deploys to Render and verifies the release.

---

## ✨ Features

**Invoicing**
- Business profile with a custom invoice prefix and an auto-incrementing invoice number per business
- Customer and product management with search, filtering, and pagination
- Multi-item invoices with automatic per-line discount and tax calculation
- Invoice statuses: `Draft`, `Pending`, `Paid`, `Partially Paid`, `Overdue`, `Cancelled`
- Payment methods: Cash, UPI, Credit Card, Debit Card, Bank Transfer, Cheque
- Invoice duplication that keeps the original payment terms
- Invoices store a **snapshot** of the business and customer details, so old invoices never change when a profile is edited

**Async processing**
- PDF invoices generated in the background with PDFKit and cached in Redis
- Invoice emails (with the PDF attached) sent through the Brevo API from a worker
- OTP, welcome, and password-reset emails sent through the same queue system
- Three retry attempts with exponential backoff for every job

**Authentication & accounts**
- Email signup with 6-digit OTP verification
- Google sign-in
- Login, logout, profile update, change password, forgot and reset password (by OTP)
- Deactivate and delete account

**Analytics dashboard**
- One endpoint returns stats, revenue chart, invoice status chart, top customers, top products, and recent invoices
- Server-side search, payment-status filter, date range, sorting, and pagination, built on MongoDB aggregation pipelines

**Operations**
- Health, liveness and readiness endpoints that check MongoDB and Redis
- Prometheus metrics endpoint plus a Grafana container
- Sentry error tracking and Winston structured logging
- Graceful shutdown of the HTTP server, workers, Redis and MongoDB
- Interactive API docs with Swagger UI (OpenAPI 3.0)

## 🏗️ Architecture

    Client["Client<br/>React app or Postman"] -->|HTTPS + cookies| API["Express 5 API"]

    API --> MW["Middleware<br/>Helmet, CORS, rate limiting,<br/>JWT auth, validation"]
    MW --> CTRL["Controllers"]
    CTRL --> SVC["Services"]
    SVC --> REPO["Repositories"]
    REPO --> DB[("MongoDB")]

    SVC <-->|cache, OTPs, rate limits| REDIS[("Redis")]
    SVC -->|enqueue jobs| QUEUES["BullMQ queues"]

    QUEUES --> WORKERS["Workers"]

    WORKERS --> BREVO["Brevo email API"]

    API -.->|/metrics| PROM["Prometheus"] -.-> GRAF["Grafana"]
    API -.->|errors| SENTRY["Sentry"]
```

The code follows a strict layered structure: **routes → controllers → services → repositories → models**. Controllers handle HTTP only, services hold the business logic, and repositories are the only layer that talks to MongoDB.

### Example: emailing an invoice

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant A as API
    participant Q as BullMQ (Redis)
    participant W as Invoice email worker
    participant B as Brevo

    C->>A: POST /api/v1/invoice/:id/email
    A->>A: Check the invoice belongs to the user
    A->>Q: Add job to invoice-email queue
    A-->>C: 202 Accepted with jobId
    Q->>W: Deliver job
    W->>W: Load invoice and render PDF
    W->>B: Send email with PDF attached
    Note over W,Q: On failure the job is retried<br/>up to 3 times with exponential backoff
```

### Background queues

| Queue | Purpose | Worker action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `send-email` | OTP, welcome, and password-reset emails | Sends the email through Brevo |
| `invoice-pdf` | On-demand invoice PDF generation | Builds the PDF and caches it in Redis for 1 hour |
| `invoice-email` | Emailing an invoice to a customer | Builds the PDF and sends it as an attachment |

All queues use 3 attempts with exponential backoff (5 s base delay) and keep the last 100 completed and failed jobs. Each worker processes up to 5 jobs concurrently. Workers start together with the API process, and `npm run worker` runs the email worker on its own.

**PDF download flow:** `GET /invoice/:id/pdf` returns the file straight from Redis when it is cached. On a cache miss it queues a job and returns `202` with a `jobId`; once the worker finishes, the next request is served from cache.

---

## 🗄️ Data Model

Every business object belongs to a `USER`, and every repository query is scoped by that user's ID. Invoices keep a **snapshot** of the business and customer at creation time, and each invoice item copies the product's name, price, tax and discount, so historical invoices never change when a profile or product is edited.

## 🗺️ Route Flow (all endpoints)

A single end-to-end journey through every route, in the order a real client actually calls them — sign up, verify, log in, set up the business, create an invoice, and get it to the customer. Every step also carries its rate limiter and, where it matters, its Redis/BullMQ behavior, so you can narrate `signup → verify-otp → login` or `create invoice → pdf → email` straight off this diagram.

**How to read it for an interview walkthrough:**
- Follow the top path for the auth lifecycle: `signup → verify-otp → login → refresh-token`. OTPs live in Redis with a 5-minute TTL, tokens live in HttpOnly cookies, and refresh tokens rotate on every use.
- Follow the middle path for the core product loop: business/customer/product setup → `create invoice` (inside a MongoDB transaction) → `pdf`/`email`, where both return `202` immediately and hand off to a BullMQ worker.
- The branch diamonds (`OTP valid?`, `login valid?`, `PDF cached?`) are the actual conditional logic in the services — useful for explaining retries, lockouts, and cache hit/miss behavior.
- Every write route still carries its own Redis-backed rate limiter (named on the node), so limits hold even if the API scales to multiple instances.

## 🔐 Security

| Area | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| **Password storage** | bcrypt hashing with salt |
| **Email verification** | 6-digit OTP stored in Redis with a 5-minute expiry; the account is created only after verification |
| **Sessions** | 15-minute access token and 15-day refresh token, both in `HttpOnly`, `Secure` cookies |
| **Refresh tokens** | Stored server-side and rotated on every use, so a used or revoked token stops working |
| **Brute-force protection** | Account locks for 15 minutes after 5 failed logins, plus per-route rate limiting |
| **Rate limiting** | Redis-backed limiters for login, signup, OTP, password reset, token refresh, and each business, customer, product and invoice action, so limits hold across multiple server instances |
| **Data isolation** | Every repository query is scoped by the authenticated user's ID |
| **HTTP hardening** | Helmet headers, CORS restricted to `CLIENT_URL` with credentials, `trust proxy` for deployment behind a load balancer |
| **Input validation** | express-validator rules on every write endpoint |
| **Errors** | One central error handler returns clean JSON to clients while stack traces go to logs and Sentry |

### Authentication flow

The four steps a client goes through: **signup → verify OTP → login → refresh token**. Every protected route afterwards is checked by `authMiddleware`, and every database query is scoped to `req.user._id`.

## ⚡ Caching Strategy

| Data | Redis key | TTL | Invalidation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Business profile | `business:{userId}` | 10 min | Refreshed on update |
| Invoice | `invoice:{invoiceId}:{userId}` | 10 min | Deleted on update or delete |
| Invoice PDF | `invoice:pdf:{userId}:{invoiceId}` | 1 hour | Deleted on update or delete |
| Dashboard | `dashboard:{userId}:{query}` | 10 min | Expires by TTL |
| Signup and reset OTP | `otp:{type}:{email}` | 5 min | Deleted after verification |

## 📊 Observability

- **Health:** `/api/v1/health`, `/health/live` and `/health/ready` for Docker, Kubernetes, and uptime monitors
- **Metrics:** `/api/v1/metrics` exposes default Node.js metrics, `http_requests_total`, and the `http_request_duration_seconds` histogram, labelled by method, route and status code
- **Dashboards:** Prometheus and Grafana run alongside the API in Docker Compose
- **Errors:** unhandled errors are captured in Sentry
- **Logs:** Winston writes structured JSON to the console and to `logs/app.log` and `logs/error.log`

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or later
- MongoDB (Atlas or a local **replica set**, see the note below)
- Redis 7 or later
- A [Brevo](https://www.brevo.com/) account and API key for email
- A Google OAuth client ID if you want Google sign-in

> **MongoDB note:** invoice creation uses multi-document transactions to allocate invoice numbers safely. Transactions need a replica set, so use MongoDB Atlas or run a local single-node replica set. A plain standalone `mongod` will reject invoice creation.

### Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nikhilsingh2764/invoice-processing-and-async-email-automation-api.git
cd invoice-processing-and-async-email-automation-api/Backend

cp .env.example .env      # then fill in your values
npm install
npm run dev               # API and workers on http://localhost:8000
```

### Run with Docker

```bash
cd Backend
cp .env.example .env      # required, the compose file reads it
docker compose up --build
```

| Service | URL |
| --- | --- |
| API | http://localhost:8000 |
| Swagger docs | http://localhost:8000/api-docs |
| Prometheus | http://localhost:9090 |
| Grafana | http://localhost:3000 |

The compose file overrides `REDIS_URL` and `MONGODB_URI` to point at its own containers. On macOS or Windows, change the Prometheus target in `prometheus/prometheus.yml` from `172.17.0.1:8000` to `host.docker.internal:8000`.

### Scripts

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the API and workers with Nodemon |
| `npm start` | Start the API and workers (production) |
| `npm run worker` | Run the email worker as a standalone process |

### Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `PORT` | Server port (default `8000` in Docker) |
| `NODE_ENV` | `development` or `production` |
| `MONGODB_URI` | MongoDB connection string |
| `REDIS_URL` | Redis connection string |
| `CLIENT_URL` | Frontend origin allowed by CORS |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` | Secret for signing access tokens |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN` | Access token lifetime, for example `15m` |
| `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET` | Secret for signing refresh tokens |
| `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN` | Refresh token lifetime, for example `15d` |
| `BREVO_API_KEY` | Brevo API key for sending email |
| `EMAIL_USER` | Verified sender address in Brevo |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Google OAuth client ID |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | Sentry project DSN (optional) |

Use long, random values for the token secrets and never commit your `.env` file.

## 🔄 CI/CD

Every push and pull request to `main` runs the pipeline in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml). A push to `main` also triggers a Render deploy and verifies the live API. The right-hand side of the diagram shows the Docker Compose stack used for local and self-hosted runs.

The pipeline fails if the image does not build or if the deployed API does not answer its health endpoint.

## 🧠 Design Decisions

- **Queue instead of inline work:** PDF rendering and third-party email calls are slow and can fail. Moving them to BullMQ keeps API latency low and gives retries and backoff for free.
- **Transaction for invoice numbers:** reserving the next invoice number and saving the invoice happen in one MongoDB transaction, so two simultaneous requests can never produce a duplicate number.
- **Snapshots in invoices:** an invoice copies the business and customer details at creation time. Later edits to a profile do not rewrite history, which matters for accounting records.
- **Repository layer:** database access lives in one place, which keeps services testable and makes the user-scoping rule easy to enforce.
- **Redis for shared state:** rate limits, OTPs, and cached data live in Redis, so the API can run as several instances without losing consistency.
- **Graceful shutdown:** on shutdown the server stops taking requests, lets workers finish, then closes Redis and MongoDB.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] Automated tests (Jest and Supertest) wired into the CI pipeline
- [ ] Routes for polling PDF and email job status (the controllers already exist)
- [ ] Bull Board dashboard for monitoring queues and failed jobs
- [ ] Single-node MongoDB replica set in Docker Compose for one-command local setup
- [ ] Payment-link integration and recurring invoices
